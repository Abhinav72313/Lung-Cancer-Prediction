# Lung Cancer Survival Prediction

A comprehensive machine learning project that analyzes lung cancer patient data to predict survival outcomes. This project implements both traditional machine learning and deep learning approaches with extensive data analysis and preprocessing.


## üéØ Overview

This project focuses on predicting lung cancer patient survival using comprehensive medical and demographic data. The analysis includes extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and implementation of both traditional machine learning (Logistic Regression) and deep learning (Neural Networks) approaches.

### Key Objectives:
- Predict patient survival outcomes based on medical and demographic features
- Identify key factors influencing survival rates
- Compare traditional ML vs. deep learning performance
- Handle class imbalance using SMOTE techniques
- Provide comprehensive data visualization and insights

## üìä Dataset

The dataset (`dataset_med.csv`) contains comprehensive lung cancer patient records with medical, demographic, and treatment information.

### Target Variable:
